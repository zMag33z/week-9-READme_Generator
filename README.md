# **OOPS! Looks like I'm under construction**

## Description:
Welcome to my markdown file generator. One can quickly and easily create a README file by using the command line. This application interface, dependant upon user input, will create Professional README documentation. This will allow a developer more time to working on a project.

## Getting Started:
![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/node.svg)<br>First to get started you will need to have downloaded Node.js.  If you haven't, you may go here. [_Node.js downloads_](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installations:
![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/inquirer.svg)<br>inquirer [_for more information_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)


First, travel to the directory folder containing the index.js file and open in VSCode.  Second, right click on the index.js file, select 'Open in Integrated Terminal'.  Third, once the terminal opens, on the command line type the first provided code example.  Fourth, on the command line type the second provided code example.  Now you'll noticed a folder name node_modules has appeared.  These are the packets needed to run inquirer.

_Example 1:_
```shell
npm init -y
```

_Example 2:_
```shell
npm i inquirer@8.2.4
```

## Usage:
Once the above installations are complete, to initalize application, on the command line type: node.js index.js.  You'll be guided through a series of prompts that will generate a README file containing most sections you would like to add to your file.  At the beginning there is also a helpful hint to remind you the language syntax a markdown file uses and how it can be useful to use with your input.
