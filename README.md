# **README.md Generator using Node.js with *inquirer***

### Welcome to my markdown file generator. Where one can quickly and easily create a README file by using the command line. This application interface, dependant upon user input, will create ***Professional*** README documentation. In turn, it allows a developer more time to working on a project.  All sections available are being showcased in this *Current* README.<br><br>

## Getting Started:

![npm version](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-v18.12.1-9cf)<br>First to get started you will need to have downloaded Node.js.  If you haven't, you may go here.&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Node.js downloads*](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installations:

![npm version](https://img.shields.io/badge/inquirer-v8.2.4-9cf)<br>inquirer&nbsp;&nbsp;[*for more information*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

*For example 1:*&nbsp;&nbsp;First, travel to the directory folder containing the index.js file and open in VSCode.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, right click on the index.js file, select 'Open in Integrated Terminal'.&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, once the terminal opens, on the command line type the first provided code example *below*.<br><br>*For example 2:*&nbsp;&nbsp;On the command line type the second provided code example *below*.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now you'll noticed a folder name node_modules has appeared.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the packets needed to run inquirer.

*Example 1:*
```shell
npm init -y
```

*Example 2:*
```shell
npm i inquirer@8.2.4
```

## Usage:

Once the above installations are complete, to initalize the application, on the command line type the *example* provided below.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning there will be a log that states the languages a markdown file recognizes and how it may be useful to use with your input.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you'll be guided through a series of prompts that will generate a README file containing *mostly* the criteria you would like to add to your file.

*Example:*
```shell
node.js index.js
```
