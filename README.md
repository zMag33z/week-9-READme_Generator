# **README.md Generator using Node.js with *inquirer***

### Welcome to my markdown file generator. Where one can quickly and easily create a README file by using the command line. This application interface, dependant upon user input, will create ***Professional*** README documentation. In turn, it allows a developer more time to working on a project.<br><br>

## Getting Started:

![npm version](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-v18.12.1-9cf)<br>First to get started you will need to have downloaded Node.js.  If you haven't, you may go here.&nbsp;&nbsp;[*Node.js downloads*](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installations:

![npm version](https://img.shields.io/badge/inquirer-v8.2.4-9cf)<br>inquirer&nbsp;&nbsp;[*for more information*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

*For example 1:*&nbsp;&nbsp;First, travel to the directory folder containing the index.js file and open in VSCode.  Second, right click on the index.js file, select 'Open in Integrated Terminal'.  Third, once the terminal opens, on the command line type the first provided code example *below*.<br><br>*For example 2:*&nbsp;&nbsp;On the command line type the second provided code example *below*.  Now you'll noticed a folder name node_modules has appeared.  These are the packets needed to run inquirer.

*Example 1:*
```shell
npm init -y
```

*Example 2:*
```shell
npm i inquirer@8.2.4
```

## Usage:

Once the above installations are complete, to initalize the application, on the command line type: <span style ="color: yellow">node.js index.js.</span>  In the beginning there is a log stating the languages a markdown file recognizes and how it may be useful to use with your input.  Then you'll be guided through a series of prompts that will generate a README file containing *mostly* the type of sections you would like to add to your file.

## Contributions:

This code is only copyable and forkable for personal use at this time.

## Tests:

First test, for adding multiple files, ask one message repeated until condition met while changing message output slightly. example: add file 1. add file 2. add file 3.  May be possible with a while loop in filter or use reactive interface or both.  Second test, find a way to ask for input and seperate that input to be inserted into certain locations.  example: enter person's name and profile link.  [person's name](profile link).  Possible again with a while loop or filter with input parameters or again reactive interface.

## Questions:

For any questions or additional feedback.
